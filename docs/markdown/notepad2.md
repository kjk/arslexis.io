# Notepad2 for web

[Notepad2 for web](https://onlinetool.io/notepad2/) is a web browser re-implementation of [notepad2](https://github.com/zufuliu/notepad2), a lightweight text / code editor for Windows.

We try to faithfully recreate notepad2, within the limits of what's possible in the browser.

Major features:
* fast, lightweight code and text editor
* can open files from your computer (in browsers that support it)
* can store files in the browser
* syntax highlighting for large number of programming languages
* windows-like UI: menu, toolbar
* implements 80%+ of notepad2 functionality
